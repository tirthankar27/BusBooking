 Sorry, we probably made a mistake, and this is a bug.

Your assistance in bug reporting will enable us to fix this for the next release.
To report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

file We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.
